0h-zjBukYpk_13,he carried it,1.25,train
0h-zjBukYpk_14,which is a smart move since you know you have to be real comic book fan to get what hes name is supposed to be,1.4,train
0h-zjBukYpk_15,but its pretty selfexplanatory but,0.0,train
0h-zjBukYpk_16,um i actually think that liev schreiber is a good actor,0.6,train
0h-zjBukYpk_17,and he almost looks exactly the same as this character in defiance,0.2,train
0h-zjBukYpk_18,i mean it was like he was too lazy to take off the costume or something,-2.0,train
0h-zjBukYpk_19,now other performances are borderline,-0.4,train

0h-zjBukYpk_21,actually i liked him a lot,2.0,train
0h-zjBukYpk_22,and i thought he made a good actor for the dead poor character,1.8,train

1DmNV9C1hbY_4,it reminded me of getting up on a saturday morning and eating fruit loops and um watching cartoons,2.0,train
1DmNV9C1hbY_5,but you know for this one i just didnt care,-1.8,train
1DmNV9C1hbY_6,um i saw no reason why they needed to bring back the villain from the first one,-1.6,train
1DmNV9C1hbY_7,and um while the trailer made the film look real nice and cute,-1.6,train
1DmNV9C1hbY_8,it was just flat,-1.8,train

1DmNV9C1hbY_10,kids are gonna love the film,2.6,train
1DmNV9C1hbY_11,but for me i was just a little bored,-1.8,train

1iG0909rllw_2,lets face it they are really not master pieces,-1.75,train
1iG0909rllw_3,i thought twilight directed by catherine hardwicke was actually really rather enjoyable,2.0,train
1iG0909rllw_4,um i mean obviously it had its flaws,-1.2,train
1iG0909rllw_5,but cinematicly i thought it was good quite good,2.2,train
1iG0909rllw_6,it wasit was enjoyable,1.6,train
1iG0909rllw_7,i wasnt thinking on hearing that chris weitz was gonna start the new moon because of the destruction that was phillip pullman the golden compassi thought,-0.6,train
1iG0909rllw_8,that film was awful,-2.4,train
1iG0909rllw_9,and i i didint really know what to expect from new moon um in terms of his direction,-0.2,train
1iG0909rllw_10,overall new moon was it was ok just average,0.6,train
1iG0909rllw_11,the thing is its a very good translation of the book,2.2,train
1iG0909rllw_12,its very very loyal to the book,1.6,train
1iG0909rllw_13,and i really appreciate that loyalty,1.4,train
1iG0909rllw_14,um however it is this loyalty to the original source that gives it its flaws,-0.2,train
1iG0909rllw_15,book is not necessarily the most thrilling book ever,-1.4,train
1iG0909rllw_16,i mean the entire xxx is bella swan kristen kristens stewards character mobbing around completely depressed,-1.4,train
1iG0909rllw_17,it wasnt really the best the most thrilling read ever ill say that,-1.4,train
1iG0909rllw_18,so overallnew moon even with the bigger better budgets huh it was still too long,-1.8,train
1iG0909rllw_19,the angsty too angsty moments withdrawn out to the max as far as thay can go,-1.0,train
1iG0909rllw_20,and the script it left all the key plots and emotion from the characters to be exposed through dialogue,0.4,train
1iG0909rllw_21,i think it was empire magazines review of new moon that said that kristen relied heavily on the tactic of tactic of blinking a lot which she really does do a lot,-0.4,train
1iG0909rllw_22,but at the same goes for rob pattinson as edward and taylor lautner as jacob they do a lot of frowning im a manly man and i frown,-0.2,train
1iG0909rllw_23,for the moment in this the whole cinema was laughting and,1.8,train
1iG0909rllw_24,and you knew you shouldnt be laughing,-1.0,train
1iG0909rllw_25,my favorite scene would definately be the volturi um,2.0,train

1iG0909rllw_27,and um michael sheen as aro as well he was rather enjoyable to watch,1.8,train
1iG0909rllw_28,and i think the volturi that was my exciting bit of the entire film,1.2,train
1iG0909rllw_29,the rest of the film was just watching kristen just mob around,-1.4,train
1iG0909rllw_30,and that was really boring,-1.6,train

2WGyTLYerpo_54,i just thought it was kind of stupid,-2.0,train
2WGyTLYerpo_55,and sometimes it kind of veers into cliche action movie territory,-1.0,train
2WGyTLYerpo_56,like a movie called cowboys and aliens a lot of people would think would be kind of like crazy,-0.4,train
2WGyTLYerpo_57,but sometimes it just veers entirely cliche action movie territory again,-1.6,train
2WGyTLYerpo_58,not a huge flaw but its there and its noticable overall,-1.4,train
2WGyTLYerpo_59,overall i really enjoyed cowboys and aliens,2.0,train

2iD-tVS8NPw_3,i enjoyed it for what it was you know,1.4,train
2iD-tVS8NPw_4,its a huge sort of spectacle movie that is great for this summer time you know,2.2,train
2iD-tVS8NPw_5,this is a movie that youre gonna go out and see,2.0,train
2iD-tVS8NPw_6,and you wanna see it in 3d because,2.0,train
2iD-tVS8NPw_7,because i i would actually say this probably is one of the first movies this year that ive seen this year that you wanna see in 3d especially for just the opening portion,2.4,train
2iD-tVS8NPw_8,it looks really good,1.8,train
2iD-tVS8NPw_9,and the rest of it does look good as well,1.4,train
2iD-tVS8NPw_10,and i just had fun watching this movie,2.2,train
2iD-tVS8NPw_11,its not like a dark movie or anything,0.2,train
2iD-tVS8NPw_12,its very much a light hearted,1.2,train
2iD-tVS8NPw_13,so its perfect for kids as well as just like teenagers as well who just wanna see a lot of explosions and some crazy stuff,2.2,train
2iD-tVS8NPw_14,and you know going into it or these watching the trailers before head i was really kind of hesitant about seeing the green lantern in the first place,-1.0,train
2iD-tVS8NPw_15,because it looks like a cartoon,-1.5,train
2iD-tVS8NPw_16,im not really a huge fan of having like all these 3d characters,-1.6,train
2iD-tVS8NPw_17,because i think why not just make this you know movie this live action movie and talk cartoon,-0.6,train
2iD-tVS8NPw_18,thats really the route that youre gonna go,0.33333334,train
2iD-tVS8NPw_19,and it seemed like they were gonna go that route but,0.0,train
2iD-tVS8NPw_20,route but i think there was also some sort of like um tone within the actual um powers of the green lantern and himself and that you can basically think up of anything and you can project that into the real life,0.8,train
2iD-tVS8NPw_21,and i think having this sort of superpower almost this power to just imagine anything kind of just um helped me get passed that you know these are all cgi characters and set,1.0,train
2iD-tVS8NPw_22,this is a playground and their imaginary playground and anything can happen anything that what also made the film exciting,2.2,train
2iD-tVS8NPw_23,because you dont entirely know whats coming next,0.2,train
2iD-tVS8NPw_24,but then you kind of like walk out of the movie and youre like well i i get what happened i understand what happened,-1.0,train
2iD-tVS8NPw_25,but what what would you do for green lantern movie 2 that would be even like worth while now,-0.8,train
2iD-tVS8NPw_26,because i mean if hes able to do all of this sort of stuff like how youre supposed to really put up a force that can push him to the next level or or destroy him at the same time,0.0,train
2iD-tVS8NPw_27,and it does kind of a lea helps alleviate what that whole was is about fighting the ultimate enemy within this first movie and that the threat is still there potentially speaking,1.4,train
2iD-tVS8NPw_28,so its kind of interesting to see um where theyre gonna be going with that,1.6,train
2iD-tVS8NPw_29,im looking forward to it ive got to say,2.0,train
2iD-tVS8NPw_30,its not like the green lantern is the next batman begins or or the dark nighter,-0.4,train

6Egk_28TtTM_4,alians which i thought was awesome,2.8,train

6Egk_28TtTM_10,i am eight years old and i thought it was really s kind of scary,0.6,train
6Egk_28TtTM_11,and i think i why i would be scared is because i would feel scared and kind of sad if i lost my own mother,-1.2,train
6Egk_28TtTM_12,but it all turns out great in the end,2.4,train
6_0THN4chvY_1,and so i was kind of curious to see maybe if that was what disney was going for and it definately was what thay were going for,1.6,train
6_0THN4chvY_2,but i bet if you put them next to the new film that the style would be similar enough that you wouldnt be able to really tell what the difference is,0.6,train
6_0THN4chvY_3,um its its great if you remember that was old films,2.0,train
6_0THN4chvY_4,would be great for kids too,2.0,train

6_0THN4chvY_9,because he says issue and they think he is saying at you,-0.6,train

6_0THN4chvY_11,wanted to see how they could frame that,0.25,train
6_0THN4chvY_12,so um if you havent seen winnie the pooh and you like family films go see it,1.8,train

6_0THN4chvY_14,i definately recommend it,2.2,train

73jzhE8R1TQ_2,it wasnt like it wasnt like oh the book was so much harder than movie,-0.8,train
73jzhE8R1TQ_3,maybe because number four was not my all time favorite book,-0.8,train
73jzhE8R1TQ_4,it was a good book,1.6,train
73jzhE8R1TQ_5,but but um i wasnt crazy about it,-0.8,train

73jzhE8R1TQ_14,so since were not really sure what their financial situation is they could be like scraping by or they could be totally rich,0.0,train

7JsX8y1ysxY_6,i thought that was really funny,1.6,train
7JsX8y1ysxY_7,um there couldve been less blue nudity,-1.6,train
7JsX8y1ysxY_8,because what was weird was the fact that in part of the movie hes wearing like a blue um overall flong thing medal flong thing so i was like why not wear the whole whole time you know why why you got to go command on us,-1.2,train
7JsX8y1ysxY_9,it was funny though,1.8,train
7JsX8y1ysxY_10,hes funny,2.0,train
7JsX8y1ysxY_11,its kind of weird,-1.0,train
7JsX8y1ysxY_12,i dont know classic superhero kind of getting on kind of thing,0.6,train
7JsX8y1ysxY_13,all right so enough of the nudity,-1.6,train
7JsX8y1ysxY_14,um but what sucked what was bad was malin akerman the girl who plays the silk spectre ii um,-2.2,train
7JsX8y1ysxY_15,ii um junior lady girl i know i i mean she looked fan fantastic,-0.4,train
7JsX8y1ysxY_16,she looked phenomenal,2.2,train
7JsX8y1ysxY_17,she looked like a superhero,0.8,train
7JsX8y1ysxY_18,but she acted like power ranger,-0.4,train
7JsX8y1ysxY_19,and theres a vast difference between those two things,-0.2,train
7JsX8y1ysxY_20,ill tell you who made the movie,0.8,train
7JsX8y1ysxY_21,who was just kick ass 100 of time was the guy that played our rorschach,1.8,train
7JsX8y1ysxY_22,but anyways he was awesome,2.6,train
7JsX8y1ysxY_23,i thought that was very cool,2.4,train
7JsX8y1ysxY_24,um he was awesome,2.4,train
7JsX8y1ysxY_25,like he was incredible,2.6,train
7JsX8y1ysxY_26,the other guy that did a really good job was um jeffrey dean morgan,1.8,train
7JsX8y1ysxY_27,he did a very good job,2.0,train
7JsX8y1ysxY_28,very dark,-1.25,train
7JsX8y1ysxY_29,um i really liked sicko guy,-1.5,train
7JsX8y1ysxY_30,but um he did a really good job at acting,2.2,train
7JsX8y1ysxY_31,i was very impressed,2.2,train
7JsX8y1ysxY_32,so overall its its like a blend of youve got alternative history,0.6,train
7JsX8y1ysxY_33,and its very very interesting,1.4,train
7JsX8y1ysxY_34,um but its extremely dark,-0.6,train
7JsX8y1ysxY_35,i warn you its a very very dark,-1.0,train
7JsX8y1ysxY_36,and um theres not in my opinion there wasnt very much of a balance between sort of like the good evil kind of thing,-1.6,train
7JsX8y1ysxY_37,and it seemed like everything was sort of overwhelmingly bad,-1.6,train
7JsX8y1ysxY_38,um so at the end theres not really a whole lot of redeeming value that i think you come up with,-1.8,train
7JsX8y1ysxY_39,but um you know overall it was good,1.8,train
8OtFthrtaJM_1,which is where all great relationships should start,0.4,train
8OtFthrtaJM_2,and just its very its very chaotic at the end of this movie,-1.0,train
8OtFthrtaJM_3,i literally said out loud what que what is this movie that i am seeing what is this,-2.4,train
8OtFthrtaJM_4,i do not understand this movie,-2.0,train
8OtFthrtaJM_5,but theres a reason for that theres a reason for why i was confused,-0.2,train
8OtFthrtaJM_6,first off the commercial makes the terrible terrible mistake of saying that it is more thought provoking than inception,-2.6,train
8OtFthrtaJM_7,thanks a lot commercial,-1.4,train
8OtFthrtaJM_8,the entire time i was constantly comparing it to inception,-0.2,train
8OtFthrtaJM_9,but i must say those are some pretty big shoes to fill so i thought maybe it has a chance,0.4,train
8OtFthrtaJM_10,i i should give it a shot you know,0.6,train
8OtFthrtaJM_11,i was just waiting for joseph gordon levitt to come out just jump out any time and say its a paradox,-0.5,train
8OtFthrtaJM_12,now the only suspensful part that i found in the first thirty minutes of the movie was when matt damon first discovers the bureau in the first place,-0.8,train
8OtFthrtaJM_13,which kind of just ruins the suspense right there because if youve got some convenient guy in a fedora to just tell you oh yes we are the adjustement bureau and this is what we do you know its just kind of ruins the suspense,-2.2,train
8OtFthrtaJM_14,and now im not im not excited anymore,-1.4,train
8OtFthrtaJM_15,interestingly it turned out to be more of a romantic comedy than it was a thriller,0.0,train
8OtFthrtaJM_16,um you know it had some interesting writing,0.6,train
8OtFthrtaJM_17,you know it was it was funny at times,1.0,train
8OtFthrtaJM_18,matt damon is a you know hes a pretty funny guy,1.4,train
8OtFthrtaJM_19,but just aside from that they really dropped the ball on the suspensful parts,-2.2,train
8OtFthrtaJM_20,overall overall it had far too many plot holes,-1.8,train
8OtFthrtaJM_21,and just not enough depth to be interesting,-2.2,train
8OtFthrtaJM_22,i have to say my favorite character in the entire movie is the character thompson,2.0,train
8OtFthrtaJM_23,but hes just the creepiest old guy youll ever see in your life he stands over people when theyre asleep just staring at them,-1.0,train
8d-gEyoeBzc_1,um im gonna give the reasons why i like him,1.2,train
8d-gEyoeBzc_2,but mostly im gonna give the reasons of why i dont think hes gonna be a classic in the same way as the first movie predator or aliens,-0.8,train
8d-gEyoeBzc_3,um which i think rodrigez was going for he th th he always said that he was gonna do the sequel um he wanted this to be um th the predator equivalent of aliens,-0.2,train
8d-gEyoeBzc_4,um as um you know as aliens was to alien,-0.2,train
8d-gEyoeBzc_5,um and im gonna really point out why that i dont think he really pulled he pulled that off,-2.0,train
8d-gEyoeBzc_6,um why was a mistake really to try and do that,-1.5,train
8d-gEyoeBzc_7,um but i did enjoy it,0.2,train
8d-gEyoeBzc_8,so um im gonna point out the stuff i did like there were some action scenes in it,1.2,train
8d-gEyoeBzc_9,the characters were well developed um not all of the characters,1.4,train
8d-gEyoeBzc_10,but um i would say that um there was theres good there were four good characters in there,0.6,train
8d-gEyoeBzc_11,um i i liked agent brodys character,1.6,train
8d-gEyoeBzc_12,i thought he was um well developed,1.6,train
8d-gEyoeBzc_13,you know well drawn out character,1.4,train
8d-gEyoeBzc_14,someone you cared about,0.0,train
8d-gEyoeBzc_15,i liked the girl who was the israeli sniper,0.8,train
8d-gEyoeBzc_16,i thought she was the number one well drawn character,1.2,train
8d-gEyoeBzc_17,um i liked the russian guy juri i,1.0,train
8d-gEyoeBzc_18,um you cared you there was enough in there for you to care about him,0.6,train
8d-gEyoeBzc_19,and xxx was an interesting character,1.6,train
8d-gEyoeBzc_20,um he had some funny he had a few one lines that was quite quite funny,1.2,train
8d-gEyoeBzc_21,yeah once unfortunately um i think in the writing somewhere they they just werent um developed enough fear to care about them um and that includes is it topher graces i think i think his name was includs his character um,-2.0,train
8d-gEyoeBzc_22,um i just didnt think it was well developed enough and um i also i i include in that laurence fishburnes character as well,-1.0,train
8d-gEyoeBzc_23,who i think rodrigez when he wrote the mo wrote the movie was going for a marlon brando apocalipse now type of character,-0.4,train
8d-gEyoeBzc_24,but he actually found um when hes seen come up it slowed the movie down um and this is the problem um with predator to predators compared to predator,-1.4,train
8d-gEyoeBzc_25,predator is really well paced movie,1.8,train
8d-gEyoeBzc_26,and it picks up speed and never lets go ev even in the same xxx where they they slow you know they meant to have some dialogue and and talk about whats going on yo you know,1.0,train
8d-gEyoeBzc_27,it felt the movie slowed down wheres it in the middle of this,-1.4,train
8d-gEyoeBzc_28,when when they they with um laurence fishburne character it does slow down a great deal,-0.8,train
8d-gEyoeBzc_29,i didnt really feel um the inclusion of his charater was necessary,-1.4,train
8d-gEyoeBzc_30,um it couldve been written out,-0.8,train
8qrpnFRGt2A_1,and um i have to admit i was watching this i purposly put it on because i figured it would be something that would be stupid that i could fall asleep in the middle of and not miss too much,-1.4,train
8qrpnFRGt2A_2,just wanted something to watch while i was falling asleep,-0.4,train
8qrpnFRGt2A_3,so i didnt didnt have very high expectations for this movie,-1.6,train
8qrpnFRGt2A_4,and i um pretty much it pretty much met my low expectations for the most part,-1.4,train
8qrpnFRGt2A_5,because i three major complaints i have about this movie,-1.4,train
8qrpnFRGt2A_6,um biggest one is the cgi effects were just terrible,-2.6,train
8qrpnFRGt2A_7,and um the story was pretty weird,-1.6,train
8qrpnFRGt2A_8,um and again i i if i had to pay closer attention i might have followed it more,-0.8,train
8qrpnFRGt2A_9,and might have been it might have made more sense,-1.0,train
8qrpnFRGt2A_10,um um this movie this movie um by half way through i was checking the time and saw that this movie was two hours long,-2.2,train
8qrpnFRGt2A_11,which i mean for a movie about ji joe ninty minutes is enough,-0.8,train
8qrpnFRGt2A_12,ok i dont need a three hour mini xxx about ji joe,-2.0,train
8qrpnFRGt2A_13,but thats just me,-0.33333334,train
8qrpnFRGt2A_14,i thought that two hours was way too long for this movie,-1.8,train
8qrpnFRGt2A_15,and the last big thing was um just the the it it i know its about jijoe you know obviously its gonna be about the army but it just felt like um like um military propaganda kind of like you know,-1.6,train
8qrpnFRGt2A_16,it fell like i was watching one of those army of one commercials sometimes,-1.0,train
8qrpnFRGt2A_17,of course its too much,-0.6666667,train
8qrpnFRGt2A_18,of course its gonna be making them look good just fine,0.6,train
8qrpnFRGt2A_19,i i guess um but the funny thing is um i mean funny thing is despite as despite everything bad about this movie i ended up half way liking it,0.6,train
8qrpnFRGt2A_20,and thats because about half way through the movie i realized that this is just its really just a cartoon,-0.8,train
8qrpnFRGt2A_21,if you look at it as a live action movie you youre gonna be disappointed,-2.0,train
8qrpnFRGt2A_22,but if you look at it as a cartoon which is pretty much mostly is with all the cgi fx and,-1.0,train
8qrpnFRGt2A_23,fx and and there is a lot of it,-0.33333334,train
8qrpnFRGt2A_24,i mean this movie makes um makes um star wars pretty close,0.0,train
8qrpnFRGt2A_25,i mean its its about that level star war is,0.2,train
8qrpnFRGt2A_26,pretty close as far as just cgi heavy like this time its what its like human face and everything around that face is cartoon cgi computer effects,-1.2,train

9J25DZhivz8_6,this was probably the best 3d movie ive seen in a long time coz it actually used 3d toy,2.8,train
9J25DZhivz8_7,3d toy story had elements of it but this movie played with 3d and um different ways to come at you out of the screen,2.2,train
9J25DZhivz8_8,so i liked that a lot,2.2,train
9J25DZhivz8_9,the voice acting in this was incredible,2.6,train
9J25DZhivz8_10,steve carell voices gru and russell brand actually really impressed me with his old man voice for the doctor,1.8,train
9J25DZhivz8_11,of i couldnt i couldnt even believe it was russell brand,0.8,train
9J25DZhivz8_12,i kept i was listening bored,0.2,train
9J25DZhivz8_13,and there was maybe one time when i thought i actually heard russell brand himself,-0.25,train
9J25DZhivz8_14,but otherwise i thought he was excellentas for 3d,1.8,train
9J25DZhivz8_15,3d i say yes,1.0,train
9J25DZhivz8_16,theres one scene in this movie that makes 3d entirely worth it,2.4,train
9J25DZhivz8_17,and some people might think that theres a lot of cheap tricks,0.5,train
9J25DZhivz8_18,but theres a roller coaster scene and if you are um get a little bit motion sick you might not wanna see it in 3d because youll feel like youre on this coaster,0.6,train
9J25DZhivz8_19,i mean my stomach was almost going wohu as we went down the big drop,0.6,train
9J25DZhivz8_20,i thought it was really cool,2.4,train

9J25DZhivz8_24,and i i always think thats hilarious,1.2,train
9J25DZhivz8_25,but what made this movie really fun was some of the adult humour jabs,2.0,train
9T9Hf74oK10_1,watch this fucking movie,-0.5,train
9T9Hf74oK10_2,and um particularly the movies that i feel like shouldve gotten nominated but didnt and never let me go is actually one of those movies,1.6,train
9T9Hf74oK10_3,i think a lot of people are really split about this movie,-0.4,train
9T9Hf74oK10_4,theres a certain deadpan nature to it,-0.8,train
9T9Hf74oK10_5,it was a pretty slow movie for the most part,-1.8,train
9T9Hf74oK10_6,and it was it was thoughful but,1.0,train
9T9Hf74oK10_7,thoughful but there are you know therere critics of movies that are sometimes too thoughful in a way and i think that would never let me go,-0.8,train
9T9Hf74oK10_8,a lot of critics said that it relied too much on the audience to um explore the themes in the film and you know tightly so i guess which,-1.8,train
9T9Hf74oK10_9,um in a way a lot of the themes in never let me go which were very profound and deep,1.6,train
9T9Hf74oK10_10,they werent fully explored,-1.2,train
9T9Hf74oK10_11,and i think that the movie did rely on you to kind of figure it out and kind of deal with those ideas by yourself,0.0,train
9T9Hf74oK10_12,but regardless i thought it was a very good movie,2.2,train
9T9Hf74oK10_13,those three are some of the best young actors of today,2.6,train
9T9Hf74oK10_14,she and everything she does she has so much grace to it and so much fluidity,2.0,train
9T9Hf74oK10_15,and keira knightley i mean everybody knows her from the pirates of the carribean,-0.4,train
9T9Hf74oK10_16,but i mean in her other works like pride and prejudice shes just been realy fantastic,2.6,train
9T9Hf74oK10_17,and andrew garfield of course everybody knows him form the social network,0.0,train
9T9Hf74oK10_18,so look out for that that should be interesting,1.2,train
9T9Hf74oK10_19,but anyways they did um they did act very well,1.4,train

9T9Hf74oK10_24,and you dont exactly know whats going on,-1.0,train
9T9Hf74oK10_25,and i think early on the twist is revealed,-0.6,train
9c67fiY0wGQ_1,at first i thought the movie would appeal more to younger audience,-0.2,train
9c67fiY0wGQ_2,but i actually found myself enjoying the movie and laughing,1.8,train
9c67fiY0wGQ_3,i think the movie really depicted the liveliness of new york city while since im a new yorker myself,2.0,train

9c67fiY0wGQ_5,the movie also delivers many meaningful messages,2.0,train

Af8D0E4ZXaw_1,i cant express my thoughts and feelings about this movie adequatly without describing some specific things in the third act of the movie,-0.75,train
Af8D0E4ZXaw_2,widely believed that a sucess of green lantern movie would lead warner brothers to adapt the flash and wonder woman among possibly others,0.8,train
Af8D0E4ZXaw_3,and put them in a justice leage movie with the ritual batman and superman,0.25,train
Af8D0E4ZXaw_4,so not only that this movie have to deal with the burden of telling its own selfcontained story and setting up its own inevitable sequels,-0.4,train
Af8D0E4ZXaw_5,it had to deal with the expectations of potentially setting up all that others stuff,-0.2,train
Af8D0E4ZXaw_6,yeah not good,-2.0,train
Af8D0E4ZXaw_7,to all the green lantern fans out there i am so sorry,-2.0,train
Af8D0E4ZXaw_8,i say that for two reasons first because someone owes you an appologie and,-1.0,train
Af8D0E4ZXaw_9,an appologie and warner brothers is never gonna give you one,-1.0,train
Af8D0E4ZXaw_10,and secondly because as a marvell geek i have experienced my fair share of disappointments over the last decade and i can genuinly symphatize with you,-0.75,train
Af8D0E4ZXaw_11,before i get to the negatives of the movie let me list off a few of the positives,0.4,train
Af8D0E4ZXaw_12,i love jeffrey rush and michael clarke duncan as the voice actors,1.4,train
Af8D0E4ZXaw_13,they do a great job with their roles,2.0,train
Af8D0E4ZXaw_14,they are great additions,1.6,train
Af8D0E4ZXaw_15,i also love the casting of mark strong as sinestro hes,2.0,train
Af8D0E4ZXaw_16,hes perfect for that role,2.2,train
Af8D0E4ZXaw_17,and um finally a particular stand out scene for me was the fighter jet sequence,1.4,train
Af8D0E4ZXaw_18,it was by far my favorite action seen in the movie,2.2,train
Af8D0E4ZXaw_19,i thought it was really well put together,2.4,train
Af8D0E4ZXaw_20,and um i thought it worked worked pretty well,1.6,train
Af8D0E4ZXaw_21,um and in fact in spite of all the negatives im about to mention i thought the movie was working for a while for about the first third um but at the end of act one two significant things happened hactor hummand arrives,-0.8,train
Af8D0E4ZXaw_22,and starts chewing scenery like its a two dollar steak,-1.6,train
Af8D0E4ZXaw_23,and how jordan flies off to the green lantern core planet oh and the movie starts sequel baiting,-1.0,train
Af8D0E4ZXaw_24,these two developments together caused what was up to that point a noble effort to start falling apart at the seams,-1.6,train
Af8D0E4ZXaw_25,and it was painful to watch,-2.6,train
Af8D0E4ZXaw_26,i dont even know why i really should begin with listing off the negatives but im going to start with a few of the superficial things,-2.4,train
Af8D0E4ZXaw_27,the acting ranges from mediocrity to hamfisted from the live action actors,-1.6,train

BXuRRbG0Ugk_1,cowboys and aliens metaphoricaly speaking is like one of those nfl teams that has the talent to be a super bowl champion but instead ends up being a wild cart team that just gets dismissed in the first round of playoffs,-1.0,train
BXuRRbG0Ugk_2,yeah job pretty well done,0.8,train
BXuRRbG0Ugk_3,i mean it wasnt a bad year,-0.4,train
BXuRRbG0Ugk_4,but there was a lot of potential left on the table,0.0,train
BXuRRbG0Ugk_5,and that describes cowboys and aliens pretty well,0.0,train
BXuRRbG0Ugk_6,though i guess i should be grateful that it turned out as good as it did,1.4,train
BXuRRbG0Ugk_7,because given all the strikes that it had going against before wonder production it could have been much much worse,0.2,train
BXuRRbG0Ugk_8,fortunally some good decisions were made before the camara started rolling,1.75,train
BXuRRbG0Ugk_9,but this probably had the unfortunate side effect of raising bad expectations to unreasonable levels,-1.2,train
BXuRRbG0Ugk_10,when i saw the first trailer back in november of last year this movie immediately shot up near the top of my list of must see movies for 2011 the,2.4,train
BXuRRbG0Ugk_11,2011 the final product ultimately doesnt live up to the high order of that first trailer,-1.6,train
BXuRRbG0Ugk_12,but its still a pretty enjoyable ride if you go in wanting to see a bunch of cowboys battle a bunch of aliens yeah youll pretty much get your fill,1.2,train
BXuRRbG0Ugk_13,but if thats all youre looking for youll actually miss the best thing about this movie,0.6,train
BXuRRbG0Ugk_14,jon favreau is probably not the guy that i would hire if i was looking for a director for an action movie,-1.6,train
BXuRRbG0Ugk_15,i mean yeah hes a competent action director,-0.6,train
BXuRRbG0Ugk_16,hes action sequences are certainly a lot better than the incoherent impossible to follow slope that we see in a typical michael bay movie,0.0,train
BXuRRbG0Ugk_17,but its action isnt particulary memorable,-1.6,train
BXuRRbG0Ugk_18,and the action wasnt the most memorable thing about any on those movies,-1.4,train
BXuRRbG0Ugk_19,the ironman films are fondly remembered mostly for robert doweny jr not the action,0.2,train
BXuRRbG0Ugk_20,and the same thing has more or less happened here yeah thats right,-0.4,train
BXuRRbG0Ugk_21,the movie called cowboys and aliens daniel craig steels the whole damn show,2.4,train
BXuRRbG0Ugk_22,hes playing a variation of the iconic man with no name character that was made famous by clint eastwood,0.5,train
BXuRRbG0Ugk_23,and now that ive seen him in the role i cant imagine any other current actor trying ot pull it off,1.4,train
BXuRRbG0Ugk_24,he is perfect from start to finsih harisson ford,2.4,train
BXuRRbG0Ugk_25,is a long for the ride and having a blast as the second lead,1.0,train
BXuRRbG0Ugk_26,and the cast is pretty well rounded out with suppordting performance from guys like sam rockwell as the doc,1.6,train
BXuRRbG0Ugk_27,theyre all playing cliched stock western characters,-0.4,train
BXuRRbG0Ugk_28,but i really dont care that the characters are walking cliches when they are this well done,1.6,train
BXuRRbG0Ugk_29,and the actors do such a good job of carrying of their particular arcs,2.0,train
BXuRRbG0Ugk_30,cowboys and aliens problem is the screenplay,-2.0,train
BXuRRbG0Ugk_31,six different people got writing credit for this movie and the results are exactly what you would expect,-0.4,train

Bfr499ggo-0_7,a few times i thought that was bumped way over the top,-1.0,train
Bfr499ggo-0_8,and they kind of looked like clowns the desert scene was one of them,-1.2,train
Bfr499ggo-0_9,um but you know the premise is ok,0.4,train
Bfr499ggo-0_10,and there are a few nice moments,1.0,train
Bfr499ggo-0_11,the movie is really too long,-0.8,train
Bfr499ggo-0_12,they shouldve just cut the wedding in the beginning,-1.4,train
Bfr499ggo-0_13,its not even necessary for the plot,-1.6,train
Bfr499ggo-0_14,i also thought that desert riding the camels all troup stopped looking like clowns,-0.2,train
Bfr499ggo-0_15,but also not necessary,-1.0,train
Bfr499ggo-0_16,but i love the moment with charlotte in the closet because who hasnt experienced that,2.2,train
Bfr499ggo-0_17,and um it was just fun to see your old friends again,1.4,train
Bfr499ggo-0_18,so if your a fan id do it,0.8,train

BioHAh1qJAQ_1,im a big fan of the first tron,1.4,train
BioHAh1qJAQ_2,um i thought this is the perfect time to have a tron sequel,2.2,train
BioHAh1qJAQ_3,because um in at the beginning of the 1980s people thought that computers can do every every anything,0.4,train
BioHAh1qJAQ_4,and everything and now technology actually does anything and everything,0.25,train
BioHAh1qJAQ_5,because it kinda controls our lives so it was the perfect time for a tron sequel,1.4,train
BioHAh1qJAQ_6,unfortunately um the writers and i were not exactly on the same wavelength,-1.8,train
BioHAh1qJAQ_7,lip smacking but i will say that the first third of this movie is amazing,2.6,train

BioHAh1qJAQ_12,you have new characters that actually have a connection to the old ones,0.6666667,train
BioHAh1qJAQ_13,and once sam flynn enters the grid you know the soundtrack draws you in,1.4,train
BioHAh1qJAQ_14,the special effects look amazing,2.6,train
BioHAh1qJAQ_15,uh they dont waste a lot of time on exposition,-0.4,train
BioHAh1qJAQ_16,because the minute the soundplane enters the grid he is put in the games,0.25,train

BioHAh1qJAQ_18,all those action sequences in involving the games were great to watch,2.0,train
BioHAh1qJAQ_19,um the cho the choreography of the fights the special effects i was so happy to be back in the grid that i wasnt really thinking about the story or where the story was going,1.8,train
BioHAh1qJAQ_20,but then sam flynn meets his father and tron basically turns into a star wars prequel after that one,-1.4,train
BioHAh1qJAQ_21,disconnection then that happens at that point,-0.8,train
BioHAh1qJAQ_22,the writers just pull this out of their ass,-2.2,train
BioHAh1qJAQ_23,and the whole movie becomes about these crazy i i isos theyre,-2.0,train
BioHAh1qJAQ_24,isos and its just like or why do we need these things,-1.4,train
BioHAh1qJAQ_25,it doesnt make any sense,-1.6,train
BioHAh1qJAQ_26,because when the old flynn finds these things whatever they are theyre so wise and naive kinda like navi now that i think about it,0.8,train
BioHAh1qJAQ_27,clue which is the program that he created in the first movie kinda pulls a bunny in the boiler moment in the sense that he turns into a crazy jealous psycho stalker bitch,0.0,train

BvYR0L6f2Ig_2,i thought the first one was creative and inventive and really brought something new to the cinema,2.0,train
BvYR0L6f2Ig_3,but the second one it didnt in some ways take to the next level,0.4,train
BvYR0L6f2Ig_4,but in some ways the first one was better,-1.0,train

BvYR0L6f2Ig_11,i did like the second one,0.6,train

BvYR0L6f2Ig_13,but the rest of the actors were so wooden,-1.4,train
BvYR0L6f2Ig_14,they were just theyre just they just why acting what theyre doing anyway,-1.8,train
BvYR0L6f2Ig_15,i dont know they do seem they need to learn acting better,-1.2,train

Ci-AH39fi3Y_10,one of them was great,1.0,train
Ci-AH39fi3Y_11,and the other one was completely irrelevant as far as i can tell,-1.8,train
Ci-AH39fi3Y_12,the great plot was with hoffman tying up all loose ends and stuff,2.2,train
Ci-AH39fi3Y_13,and the irrelevant plot was with five rendom strangers,-1.2,train
Ci-AH39fi3Y_14,kind of like in saw 2 who,0.0,train
Ci-AH39fi3Y_15,but i totally missed how it tied it to the movie at all,-0.8,train
Ci-AH39fi3Y_16,and im pretty sure thats because it didnt tie in to the movie at all,-1.6,train
Ci-AH39fi3Y_17,so that was really bizzare and i didnt care about the characters at all,-2.6,train
Ci-AH39fi3Y_18,because they werent you know introduced well really,-1.2,train
Ci-AH39fi3Y_19,so it was just really really strange,-0.8,train

Ci-AH39fi3Y_23,because i sure didnt see the end coming,0.0,train
Ci-AH39fi3Y_24,but the end was really you you know,-1.0,train
Ci-AH39fi3Y_25,but i thought the best part of saw 5 was the storyline like in general,1.8,train
Ci-AH39fi3Y_26,the ending was not you know crazy shocking or anything like usual,-0.8,train
Ci-AH39fi3Y_27,it was not a real huge saw twist moment,-0.6,train
Ci-AH39fi3Y_28,um so you know that was a little surprising i guess,0.4,train
Ci-AH39fi3Y_29,thats not to say that the ending wasnt good because it really was,1.4,train
Ci-AH39fi3Y_30,but it was not exectly what i was expecting and se seriously everything leading up to the end was better than the ending,-1.0,train
Ci-AH39fi3Y_31,which is still good,1.4,train
Ci-AH39fi3Y_32,because the movie is good,2.0,train
Ci-AH39fi3Y_33,saw 5 has left like no closure at all at the end of the movie,-2.0,train
Ci-AH39fi3Y_34,and it pretty much just left the door wide open for saw 6 which,0.2,train
Ci-AH39fi3Y_35,but man oh man it really left the door open,0.8,train
Ci-AH39fi3Y_36,and it didnt even you know try to close it at all like the wind isnt gonna blow it over or anything its just open,-1.5,train
Ci-AH39fi3Y_37,but like i said the plot of hoffman and everything that was really really awesome,2.6,train
Ci-AH39fi3Y_38,and it fit very well into the saw series in my opinion,1.8,train
Ci-AH39fi3Y_39,so congratulations to the writers for that,2.0,train
Ci-AH39fi3Y_40,but ill smack them in the face for the other irrelevant plotline and,-2.6,train
Ci-AH39fi3Y_41,and dont know what the hell they were thinking,-2.2,train
Ci-AH39fi3Y_42,it was pretty much just and excuse to put traps in the movie because it was literally completely irrelevant,-2.2,train
Ci-AH39fi3Y_43,like i said i loved the hoffmans storyline,2.2,train

Dg_0XKD0Mf4_8,there were a couple funny parts,0.4,train

Oz06ZWiO20M_10,um it really is not trying to be a dramatic film or an action film,0.0,train
Oz06ZWiO20M_11,like i think most people thats their knock on it is that its not you know conventionally satisfying as like you know with drama that we dont get to know anything about these characters their play isnt interesting their path to freedom is not compelling and its basically telescoped within the first ten minutes of the movie where were sort of told whats gonna happen before it happens,-1.6,train
Oz06ZWiO20M_12,um and and all those things are true but i dont think its trying to be that,-0.6,train
Oz06ZWiO20M_13,i think its really much more like a musical,0.6,train
Oz06ZWiO20M_14,and i know this is gonna sound silly coz its such a broad goofy mainstream cult kind of movie,1.0,train
Oz06ZWiO20M_15,but it really has more in common with a musical or and opera or even a ballet than a regular narrative film,0.2,train
Oz06ZWiO20M_16,coz like am remains in narrative film is about character development and plot and then spectacle like in third place,-0.2,train
Oz06ZWiO20M_17,so its like puts some people in it and youre gonna enjoy spending time with them therere some,0.6,train

Oz06ZWiO20M_20,and then you know put in some action or some romance or sex or whatever like to keep people sort of engaged,0.8,train
Oz06ZWiO20M_21,um and thats what traditionl narrative movies do,0.4,train
Oz06ZWiO20M_22,and this movie is really much more like the plot is what little there is,-1.6,train
Oz06ZWiO20M_23,and the characters are they are all just place holders,-1.6,train
Oz06ZWiO20M_24,its really like like if you went to go see the ballet and its about the spectacles,0.8,train
Oz06ZWiO20M_25,like the story of swan lake is why people go see swan lake its the movement and the dancing and the music and the sets and the experience,1.8,train

PZ-lDQFboO8_5,now im not gonna lie therere a few parts that have great action sequences now even though it is an animated film it did have some great fight scenes,1.4,train
PZ-lDQFboO8_6,um but as far as humor goes not as much as i was expecting,-1.6,train
PZ-lDQFboO8_7,everything you see in the trailer itself was pretty much all the humor youre gonna see in the movie,-1.6,train

QN9ZIUWUXsY_1,main draw for me for this movie was just the fact that its set in this like ridiculous world with all these bright beautiful colors and ridiculous action sequences,0.4,train
QN9ZIUWUXsY_2,and i dont think thats a very good movie,-1.6,train
QN9ZIUWUXsY_3,but i do think its a very interesting one,1.2,train
QN9ZIUWUXsY_4,i can tell you that tron legacy is not a good movie,-2.4,train
QN9ZIUWUXsY_5,but i was still ridicilously entertained by it,2.6,train
QN9ZIUWUXsY_6,are these two things possible in the same sentancei i really do think so,0.8,train

QN9ZIUWUXsY_9,the script can be horrible,-2.0,train
QN9ZIUWUXsY_10,its its a bit of a mixed bag coz there were some very bright moments,0.8,train
QN9ZIUWUXsY_11,um the direction is a bit its wobbly,-1.2,train
QN9ZIUWUXsY_12,basically a lot of elements that i could take a movie on its really wobbly,-1.4,train
QN9ZIUWUXsY_13,but what it lacks in those areas it most definately makes up for just like sheer visual spectacle,1.8,train
QN9ZIUWUXsY_14,i mean this movie has the most gorgeous visuals out of any movies since probably avatar me if not prettier,2.6,train
QN9ZIUWUXsY_15,so many moments in this movie that are just framed and lit so perfectly that so that you just go like kind of huh thats really really cool,2.4,train
QN9ZIUWUXsY_16,and then take that world that have been set like a crap tunnel of really kinetic really well done action sequences in it and you have tron legacy,2.2,train

Qr1Ca94K55A_3,she didnt really do anything for me,-1.6,train
Qr1Ca94K55A_4,but the real star that fell out of this movie was william fichtner character or william fichtner,1.4,train
Qr1Ca94K55A_5,and his acting wasnt really good in that movie,-1.6,train
Qr1Ca94K55A_6,but it made it hysterical and it was just funny with all of these little one liners that he had,2.2,train
Qr1Ca94K55A_7,and whatever so no im not saying this movie is bad coz its its not,-0.8,train
Qr1Ca94K55A_8,like i said before it had tacky one liners that were just hysterical,1.6,train

Sqr0AcuoNnk_5,i just dont think it was very good,-2.2,train
Sqr0AcuoNnk_6,and this is the thing friends with benefits and no strings attached they are the same movie different ways of getting to the same point but its the same point,-0.6,train
Sqr0AcuoNnk_7,so i think that no strings attached was better than friends with benefits,0.8,train
Sqr0AcuoNnk_8,i was not bored during no strings attached,0.6,train
Sqr0AcuoNnk_9,i thought it was very funny,2.0,train

Sqr0AcuoNnk_13,he is brilliant there is not a movie that i see him in that i dont end up crying because he is so fantastic and he just breaks your heart whenever he does you know a role that usually his roles do break your heart at some point so definitely did in this movie,2.8,train
Sqr0AcuoNnk_14,i like teared up in friends with benefits because of him,1.4,train
Sqr0AcuoNnk_15,the lady who plays justin timberlakes sister um i thought she was very good in this movie,2.2,train
Sqr0AcuoNnk_16,and i thought she was just like really natural and funny,2.0,train
Sqr0AcuoNnk_17,and she looks like renee zellwegger and helen hunt from a twister movie,-0.2,train
Sqr0AcuoNnk_18,and she talks like her too,0.2,train
Sqr0AcuoNnk_19,it was weird,-1.0,train
Sqr0AcuoNnk_20,the whole time i saw her all i thought was helen hunt and renee zellwegger another,-0.4,train
Sqr0AcuoNnk_21,zellwegger another thing was the fact that there was not one healthy relationship or positive good relationship in this whole movie,-2.0,train
Sqr0AcuoNnk_22,but thats kind of depressing,-1.4,train
TvyZBvOMOTc_1,which would have been a better name for the movie,-0.2,train

TvyZBvOMOTc_5,although i enjoyed the movie,1.2,train
TvyZBvOMOTc_6,if i think about it honestly the plot wasnt that great,-1.2,train
TvyZBvOMOTc_7,its a fun chick flick,1.6,train
TvyZBvOMOTc_8,but other than that it doesnt really hold up under inspection,-1.6,train
TvyZBvOMOTc_9,lip smacking all the problems that come to stop them from getting to their destination are although plausible a little weak,-0.8,train
TvyZBvOMOTc_10,even though the whole movie is based on whether she gets to dublin in time youre never really worried about it because you know she gets there,-0.4,train
TvyZBvOMOTc_11,lip smakcing a lot of this movie brings a cute laugh here and there,1.0,train
TvyZBvOMOTc_12,and both the actors amy adams and matthew goode work well with each other,1.4,train
TvyZBvOMOTc_13,and seem to be really enjoying themselves the whole way through,1.8,train
TvyZBvOMOTc_14,even when theyre fighting in the movie though it just seems like its their banter not actual dislike,-0.8,train
TvyZBvOMOTc_15,all in all if youre looking for a cute romantic comedy with a beautiful setting then this will probably be a good movie for you,2.0,train
VCslbP0mgZI_1,of suckerpunch poop,-2.5,train

VCslbP0mgZI_3,guardians of owl land whatever that came out and i never saw it,0.0,train
VCslbP0mgZI_4,suckerpunch and this suckers getting this sucker is getting panned like last airbender garbage panned and i wanna say this i did not think it was like last airbender garbage,-2.6,train
VCslbP0mgZI_5,um heres why yes stuttering t theres problems with this and i wanna talk about them but you know it looks beautiful,0.4,train
VCslbP0mgZI_6,there are some really cool uh moments in this,2.0,train
VCslbP0mgZI_7,it actually has some some them thematically it has some cool themes about heroism and about like taking ownership of yourself and things like that which i resonated with and i whi and which i appreciated,1.8,train
VCslbP0mgZI_8,but heres the essential problem with this movie the essentail problem of this movie well maybe this would be the best way to put it um there was a uh a comedian named dave chapelle um and dave chapelle um and another comedian chris rock are um african american and in their comedy they sometimes take on african american culture what they perceive to be african american culture and so they will essentially make fun of black people and the thing with dave chapelle and with chris rock is because theyre black they can kinda do that and theres something about that thats acceptable,-1.6,train
VCslbP0mgZI_9,um if like me or laughing some other white person or hispanic person or whatever did the same jokes it would not be funny,-2.0,train
VCslbP0mgZI_10,it would be completely inappropriate in fact it would be racist,-2.2,train
VCslbP0mgZI_11,so zach snyder here is making a movie thats ostensibly about female empow empowerment but its a movie about female empowerment which includes a lot of clearing throat slapping that includes a lot of women in bustiers that includes a lot of violence done against women and ultimately in which most of the women end up completely disempowered clapping,-2.6,train
VCslbP0mgZI_12,clapping laughing so okay if zach snyder were a woman i would say okay shes making a comment about the way women cant be empowered in male dominated societies in the way men um distract and and hurt and damage women and prevent them from asserting who they really are,-0.4,train
VCslbP0mgZI_13,i could kinda see that in a sort of chris rock dave chapelle way,1.0,train
VCslbP0mgZI_14,but zach snyder is a guy and because of that this stuff kinda ends up looking like the sh he man woman haters club,-1.6,train
VCslbP0mgZI_15,so if i give zach snyder the benefit of the doubt this is a movie that looks great has some bad acting,0.4,train
VCslbP0mgZI_16,and has way too much violence against women,-1.8,train
VCslbP0mgZI_17,if i dont give zach snyder the benefit of the doubt,-0.6,train

VbQk4H8hgr0_31,i have to agree on the negative side it was not great,-1.4,train
VbQk4H8hgr0_32,it wasnt even remotely good,-2.8,train
VbQk4H8hgr0_33,i mean theres a few moments yeah that are original and funny,0.4,train
VbQk4H8hgr0_34,and theres a ne an introduction of a new character justine timberlakes character already in the film,-0.2,train
VbQk4H8hgr0_35,but they didnt even give him that much to do the he had only few minor lines,-1.8,train
VbQk4H8hgr0_36,and none of them were really that great i mean stands out in your mind,-1.4,train
VbQk4H8hgr0_37,so the addition of this character was pretty pointless,-1.8,train
VbQk4H8hgr0_38,i mean its pleasent to the story,-0.2,train
VbQk4H8hgr0_39,but i still find it pointless in the end of the movie,-2.0,train
VbQk4H8hgr0_40,and the characters just werent the same as the first two that i fell in love with them,-1.2,train
VbQk4H8hgr0_41,it just kind of made me wanna really walk out of the theater,-2.6,train
VbQk4H8hgr0_42,so that just pissed me off more,-2.4,train

_dI--eQ6qVU_12,but the humor really just nailed it,2.6,dev
_dI--eQ6qVU_13,and the action sequences in this movie are tensed i,2.6,dev

_dI--eQ6qVU_15,when they just come up with these totally completely new stylized ways of developing action sequences,1.6,dev
_dI--eQ6qVU_16,coz sure its fun to see a super hero go round and kick bad guy butt you know punch kick whatever bam,0.8,dev
_dI--eQ6qVU_17,but when they figure out a new way to interpret this,-0.25,dev
_dI--eQ6qVU_18,and add something like an extra spark in there,0.8,dev
_dI--eQ6qVU_19,that makes it more visually truly appealing,1.4,dev

bvLlb-M3UXU_8,theres a bad guy guy go take him down thats really all you need,0.0,dev
bvLlb-M3UXU_9,this movie essentially was made for three reasons in my opinion,-0.25,dev
bvLlb-M3UXU_10,the first reason is the obvious just to make an exciting enjoyable action film,1.6,dev
bvLlb-M3UXU_11,and thats you know all thats all you really needed to do,-0.2,dev
bvLlb-M3UXU_12,and definatelly comes through on that,1.2,dev
bvLlb-M3UXU_13,the second reason this movie was made and in my opinion the real reason it was made again its silvestre stalone telling himself i still got it,-1.2,dev
bvLlb-M3UXU_14,um ive got to give him credit,1.0,dev
bvLlb-M3UXU_15,hes in terrific shape for a man twice my age who looks significantly better than me,2.2,dev
bvLlb-M3UXU_16,thats kind of made me feel depressed,-1.6,dev
bvLlb-M3UXU_17,but hey whatever and is showing yeah maybe hes not what he was twenty twenty five years ago but he still has every right to be billed as an action star,1.2,dev
bvLlb-M3UXU_18,theres actually yeah yeah scenes triple stand off with silvestre arnold swarzeneger bruce willis and yeah actually in a way kind of fell hollow,-1.0,dev

f_pcplsH_V0_12,im sure you all remember the stab movies that were based on the scream movies or the experiences of sidney in universe so that people could comment on the killers reenacting the movies or following up the movies well in the first hour those become way way way too much of a plot point basically,-0.8,test
f_pcplsH_V0_13,i think xxx i want to see it,1.6,test
f_pcplsH_V0_14,but it actually basically makes the characters congition not just of the genre within which they are in but of their own franchise to a ridiculous extent,-1.0,test

fvVhgmXxadc_1,it only had the potential to be a film that was both provking and action packed,-0.4,test

fvVhgmXxadc_13,of playing with the idea whats real whats not what the matrix films did,0.2,test

iiK8YX8oH1E_12,ginnifer goodwin is fun to watch,1.8,test
iiK8YX8oH1E_13,but i dont think shes leading material,-2.0,test

tIrG4oNLFzE_4,i really did enjoy as well wasnt too fond of the ending,1.4,test

tIrG4oNLFzE_6,i mean its a nicholas sparks book it must be good,1.25,test
tIrG4oNLFzE_7,but on the other hand i was really um wary of going,-1.4,test
tIrG4oNLFzE_8,like what to expect from miley cyrus um i mean shes only done the hannah montana franchise playing that one character which i think like 99 of the percent of the time her characters like so overboard shes so exaggerated so i really didnt know how she was going to handle this film,-1.2,test
tIrG4oNLFzE_9,straight away miley cyrus acting miley cyrus acting or lack of she had this same expression throughout the entire film,-1.0,test
tIrG4oNLFzE_10,it was like this like pouty like grumpy look,-1.8,test
tIrG4oNLFzE_11,and then maybe even when she was happy like she wouldnt frown her um frown her eyebrows but shed still be pouty but like yeah like that,-1.6,test
tIrG4oNLFzE_12,which just uh it really annoyed me,-2.6,test
tIrG4oNLFzE_13,like those tho those those moments in the film especially in the beginning where she would sit there stand there cross um with her arms crossed and just look out into the distance like just laughing with the same expression or shed look across the beach or shed look at her dad or shed look at her brother with the same expression and i was just like whatre you thinking i i dont understand what this characters doing,-2.0,test
tIrG4oNLFzE_14,like okay shes staring whats she thinking how does she feel i had no idea like it was the same expression for shock or for sadness or what i presumed shed be sad but it sigh it really bugged me,-2.4,test
tIrG4oNLFzE_15,but as an actor i really think especially an actor in the lead leading role you really should prepare for that role,-2.0,test
tIrG4oNLFzE_16,i was like how can you go into a film into a leading role and have no idea who your character is,-1.6,test
tIrG4oNLFzE_17,smacking so thats probably why she just laughinglooked the same in every single scene there was probably about two scenes that i actually thought yea she this is her acting this is good she can do this,-0.4,test
tIrG4oNLFzE_18,but then those two moments just got ruined by the rest of an hour and a half of her being pouty,-2.2,test
